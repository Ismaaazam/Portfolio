              Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with a passion for merging elegant UI
              with robust backend logic. I specialize in the MERN stack and
              bring ideas to life with seamless, scalable, and secure solutions.
              Currently diving deep into cybersecurity and AI integrations, I
              thrive on solving real-world problems through clean code,
              data-driven logic, and creative thinking. With a strong foundation
              in both software engineering and emerging technologies, I aim to
              build impactful digital experiences that are both user-centric and
              future-ready.

              committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet user
              needs and business goals.
